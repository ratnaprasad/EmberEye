## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Phase D Release Gate (Required)

Run the automated readiness gate before production rollout:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/field/run_release_readiness_gate.py
```

Output contract:
- `RELEASE_READINESS_DECISION: GO` means all checks passed.
- `RELEASE_READINESS_DECISION: NO-GO` means rollout must stop and failures must be resolved.
- JSON report is written to `tests/artifacts/release_readiness_report.json`.

Rollback drill command (Phase D):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/field/run_rollback_drill.py --restart-cmd "bash scripts/runtime/start_studio.sh" --observe-seconds 15 --restore-original
```

Rollback drill output:
- `ROLLBACK_DRILL_DECISION: PASS` means scheduled reconcile stayed disabled during observation.
- JSON report is written to `tests/artifacts/rollback_drill_report.json`.

### Step 1: Extract Zip File
```bash
unzip EmberEye_Windows_Migration.zip -d C:\EmberEye_App
```

### Step 2: Verify Python Environment
```cmd
python --version  # Should be 3.7+
pip list | findstr PyQt5  # Should show PyQt5
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Build Windows Executable
```cmd
# Option A: Use existing .spec files
pyinstaller main.spec

# Option B: Use build script if available
python build_windows.py
```

### Step 5: Test Application
```cmd
# Run compiled executable
dist\EmberEye.exe

# Or run directly
python main.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

**NO CHANGES NEEDED!** The hourly EEPROM1 scheduling works automatically.

If you need to adjust the EEPROM refresh interval:
- File: `pfds_manager.py`
- Line: ~130 (in `_run_scheduler()`)
- Change: `3600` (seconds) to desired value
- Example: `7200` = 2 hours

---

## ✨ Expected Behavior

### At Application Startup
```
TCP Server: Running on port 4888
PFDS Scheduler started
PFDS: Sending PERIOD_ON to device Device1 (192.168.1.100)
✅ PERIOD_ON sent successfully to 192.168.1.100
```

### After 1 Hour (3600 seconds)
```
🔧 Sending EEPROM1 to device Device1 (192.168.1.100) [HOURLY CALIBRATION REFRESH]
   Collecting calibration offset data...

📊 EEPROM CALIBRATION APPLIED:
   ┌─ Raw hex word[0]: 0xFFB0
   ├─ Raw signed value: -80 (centi-degrees)
   ├─ Offset: -0.80°C
   ├─ Previous offset: 0.00°C
   └─ Temperature correction: raw_value ÷ 100 - (-0.80)°C

✅ EEPROM1 DATA LOADED:
   ├─ Frame ID: cam01
   ├─ Total size: 3328 chars (832 blocks)
   ├─ Calibration offset: -0.80°C
   └─ Status: Ready for temperature conversion

✅ EEPROM1 CALIBRATION RECEIVED:
   ├─ Device: 192.168.1.100
   ├─ Offset: -0.80°C
   ├─ Timestamp: 2025-12-04 15:47:32
   └─ Next update: In ~1 hour
```

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Tests

### Test 1: Device Connection
- [ ] Connect thermal device via TCP port 4888
- [ ] Verify "PERIOD_ON successfully sent" message appears
- [ ] Verify thermal data starts streaming

### Test 2: EEPROM Data Collection (Wait 1 Hour)
- [ ] Wait for EEPROM1 command to be sent automatically
- [ ] Verify "EEPROM CALIBRATION APPLIED" message appears
- [ ] Check offset value printed in console
- [ ] Verify timestamp shows current time

### Test 3: Temperature Display
- [ ] Compare offset value with room temperature
- [ ] Example: If room is 28°C and offset is -0.80°C
- [ ] Raw sensor ~2880 should display as ~28°C
- [ ] Verify negative values don't appear (unless offset is positive)

### Test 4: Continuous Monitoring
- [ ] Leave application running for 2+ hours
- [ ] Verify EEPROM1 command sent again (every hour)
- [ ] Verify offset logged with each update
- [ ] Verify timestamps increment correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No EEPROM1 command sent after 1 hour
**Solution:**
1. Check if device is still connected
2. Verify TCP port (default 4888) is accessible
3. Check device logs for EEPROM1 support
4. Restart application and wait again

### Issue: Temperatures still showing negative
**Solution:**
1. Check EEPROM offset value in console logs
2. If offset = +50°C but room is 28°C, offset is wrong
3. May need device-level recalibration
4. Contact device manufacturer for offset reset

### Issue: "EEPROM calibration parse error"
**Solution:**
1. Verify EEPROM1 response format is correct (3328 chars)
2. Check device returns valid hex characters
3. Verify device supports new EEPROM1 protocol
4. Try firmware update on device if available

### Issue: Application crashes on EEPROM receipt
**Solution:**
1. Check Python error log for detailed traceback
2. Verify thermal_frame_parser.py imports are correct
3. Run: `python -m py_compile thermal_frame_parser.py`
4. Check if hex data exceeds expected size

---

## 📊 Performance Impact

- **CPU**: Minimal (only processes EEPROM once per hour)
- **Memory**: +~100 KB for timestamp tracking
- **Network**: ~3-5 KB per EEPROM1 response
- **Disk**: ~50 bytes per hour in debug logs

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All TCP communication remains unchanged
- EEPROM data is read-only (no device state changes)
- No new external dependencies added
- Offset values validated (range: -100°C to +100°C)

---

## 📝 Notes

1. **Automatic Scheduling**: No manual intervention required
2. **Both Modes Supported**: Works with Continuous and On Demand
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing configurations continue to work
4. **Zero Configuration**: No config file changes needed
